# Web Scraping Book Information

This Python script demonstrates how to scrape book information (title, price, and rating) from the website "books.toscrape.com" using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.

## Description

The script fetches the HTML content of the target website, parses it using BeautifulSoup, and extracts the desired information for each book on the page.  It then prints the extracted data to the console in a user-friendly format.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `requests` library:  `pip install requests`
- `beautifulsoup4` library: `pip install beautifulsoup4`

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the script):**  If you cloned the repo, navigate to the directory containing the script. If you downloaded the script, make sure you're in the correct directory in your terminal or command prompt.
2.  **Install the required libraries:** If you haven't already, run the following commands in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py  # Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your script.
    ```
